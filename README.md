# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
This project implements a Python function to calculate the mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements of a 3x3 matrix. The input is a list of 9 numbers, and the function outputs a dictionary with the calculated statistics.

## Features
Validates input to ensure exactly 9 numbers are provided.
Converts the input list into a 3x3 Numpy array.
### Calculates:
Mean (average)
Variance (spread of the data)
Standard Deviation (square root of variance)
Maximum value
Minimum value
Sum of elements
Outputs results in a well-structured dictionary.
